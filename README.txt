REQUIREMENTS:
Python 3.7.6 64-bit ('base': conda) works best in this version
Installing Anaconda would be preferred, since without it, you have to install some packages.

HOW TO USE:
Step 1: Download this repository and extract it.
Step 2: Perform multiple sequence alignment in Jalview.
Step 3: Copy the sequence for your desired protein, including the dashes inserted during alignment and paste it into a file called "sequence.txt"
Step 4: Export the Jalview Consensus to a CSV file, and name it "file.csv".
Step 5: Open the jalview_alignment.py file to start the program, and when it finishes, you will get an output file of the amino acids ranked by consensus in the multiple sequence alignment.

NOTE: I added a sample sequence.txt and file.csv, where the protein is Alpha-L-Fucosidase from Thermotoga maritima, and it has been aligned with the rest of the GH29 enzyme family.
